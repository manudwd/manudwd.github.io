        <p class="lead-text">My path began at the intersection of hardware and intelligence. Starting with silicon-level design at IBM, I learned that true innovation happens when you understand every layer—from the transistors to the algorithms.</p>
        
        <p class="lead-text">At Michigan State, I discovered my passion: making AI efficient enough to run on the edge. I reduced Generative AI compute by 45% on FPGAs without sacrificing performance—proving that smarter design beats brute force.</p>
        
        <p class="lead-text">Today, I'm pioneering a new paradigm: using the wireless signals already around us—5G, LTE, WiFi—as a sensing medium. Instead of deploying expensive radar systems, we're turning existing infrastructure into intelligent eyes that can detect falls in elderly care, track drones for security, and monitor traffic for smart cities—all without additional hardware.</p>
        
        <p class="lead-text">From RTL to production, from research papers to MWC showcases, I build systems that matter. Every line of code, every optimization, every patent serves one purpose: creating technology that protects people and enhances lives.</p>

            <p><strong>Leading the next generation of wireless sensing.</strong> I'm now pioneering uplink-based sensing—a paradigm shift that opens entirely new possibilities. Working with NVIDIA and Northeastern University, we're reimagining how 5G networks can understand and respond to the world around them.</p>
            <p>My work spans from defense applications with the US Army to life-saving fall detection for elderly care. Each project starts with a question: "How can we use what's already there to solve real problems?" The answer is reshaping how Tier-1 carriers, security firms, and cities think about infrastructure.</p>
            <p>This year, our innovations will be showcased at MWC Barcelona 2025—not as prototypes, but as production-ready solutions changing how we interact with wireless networks.</p>

            <p><strong>This is where everything came together.</strong> In just over a year, I went from architecting solutions to seeing them deployed in real cities, winning awards, and filing patents.</p>
            <p>The breakthrough moment was building the first band-agnostic UAV detection system. While others struggled with cluttered environments, we achieved 95% accuracy by thinking differently—not just about the algorithm, but about how signals propagate, reflect, and reveal information.</p>
            <p>Working with the City of Elk Grove, we proved the concept at scale: 99.6% accuracy tracking pedestrians and traffic from 250m to 1.3km away. No cameras, no additional infrastructure—just intelligent processing of signals already in the air.</p>
            <p>My work on closed-loop network assurance won Deutsche Telekom's <em>Most Integration Potential Award</em> (€25,000), recognizing not just technical excellence, but the vision of networks that understand and adapt to their environment.</p>
            <p>From RTL design to bare-metal deployment on Yocto, from research papers to executive presentations at Verizon and T-Mobile—I built systems that work, not just in the lab, but in production. The Arria10 SoC demo at MWC 2024 wasn't just a showcase; it was proof that edge AI can be both powerful and efficient.</p>
            <p>Two patents, multiple publications, and multimillion-dollar proposals later, I've established that ISAC isn't just possible—it's the future of wireless infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Reproducing the SenseFi paper taught me that research isn't just about reading—it's about understanding deeply enough to rebuild and improve. Optimizing FPGA inference for Ultrascale+ RFSoC showed me that every cycle matters when you're running AI at the edge.</p>
            <p>This is where I learned to think in systems: from RF signals to TensorFlow models to Docker deployments. Every piece had to work together seamlessly.</p>

            <p>I learned that every algorithm has assumptions, and challenging those assumptions opens new possibilities. Building sparse CV models that handled occlusion and blur better than traditional approaches taught me to think about robustness from first principles.</p>

            <p>Building the first single-thread architecture for GenAI acceleration on UltraScale+ SoC wasn't just about performance—it was about proving that innovative architecture can unlock capabilities others thought impossible. The 4× ALU throughput improvement came from questioning fundamental assumptions about how data flows through systems.</p>
            <p>This foundation—VHDL, Verilog, RTL design—is what allows me to optimize systems others can't even see. When I'm optimizing ML models for FPGAs today, I'm building on lessons learned here.</p>
